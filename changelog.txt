Version 2.0b
	Added support for the new version of the ProtonVPN cli tool.

Version 0.7
	Added **Experimental** Kill-Switch to the Opt menu.
		When activated in the Opt menu it will halt *all* network traffic on your machine on a VPN disconnection detection.
		Reconnect by using the VPN menu only, typing sudo pvpn -c will not work, as you will have no internet connection .'
		Do not close the GUI while kill-switch is activated, if you do, or the GUI crashes for some reason:
			A backup of your iptables is made in your home directory, called 'iptables.backup'.
			'sudo iptables -F' followed by 'sudo iptables-restore ~/iptables.backup' 
			Reooting your machine will also remove the kill-switch.
	kill.sh is now a required download.
	iprestore.sh is now a required download.
	ipsave.sh is now a required download.
	Updated readme, and Help/FAQ Dialog.
